        <p class="text--big">This archive brings together digital online projects which uses data visualization to support alternative narratives to the ones from dominant power. It aims to raise knowledge and gather the design expertise on the relevant task of portraying evidence to not-visible or alternative social issues that arenâ€™t been told by the main power institutions. At the same time, the archive aim to bring to the fore discussion and awareness on the political role of designers when they design with data. Visualizations for alternative narratives should have and should promote a critical approach to data.</p>
        <h2>What are alternative narratives and why are they important?</h2>
        <p class="text--big">Alternative narratives are those that provide different stories from the ones of dominant power structures, such as information provided by governments, corporations, organizations, the media, etc.</p>
        <h2>Why make a archive?</h2>
        <p class="text--big">An archive collects documents or historical records that provide information about a place, institution or group of people. There are different efforts around the world that fragmentarily support the construction of alternative narratives to those delivered by dominant structures.</p>
        <p class="text--big">This archive seeks to collect collaboratively and leave open these efforts to build knowledge and foster good practices in the use of data for the construction of alternative narratives. At the same time, it seeks to preserve these efforts which, in a volatile manner, disappear on the Internet, many of them without being updated.</p>
