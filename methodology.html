        <p class="text--huge">This section outlines the archive theoretical, political and a pedagogical frame. It
            explains how cases were collected and what the tags used to classify projects mean. The aim is to disclose
            how this archive is being built, to ask users to be critical and see if the tags are meaningful or if
            disagree with them and why. At the same time, revealing the theoretical part that backs up the archive
            seeks to promote the creation of data visualisations that support the future creation of alternative
            narratives.</p>
        <h2 id="sect1">How were cases collected?</h2>
        <p class="text--big">The collected cases include projects that have to due with social objectives that seek to
            engage audiences through the communication of alternative visions of the world using data in digital
            platforms. All projects were developed by independent and mainly bottom-up organizations such as
            self-organized citizen groups, NGOs , independent civil society organizations, researchers. They are
            non-profit, not private or business sector oriented. Beyond these characteristics, the projects responds to
            the filter of "spaces of confrontation" criterion based on Chantal Mouffe agonistic theory (2000).The space
            is configured by three axes: revelation, dissenssus and confrontation. The axes serves for identifying
            cases that bring alternative stories that challenge dominant power.</p>
        <h2 id="sect2">About the typology of projects</h2>
        <p class="text--big">Based on each project purpose (mainly inferred or retrieved from their "about" section) It
            is proposed a taxonomy of data-driven alternative narratives which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Memory and archives cluster:</strong> projects the main characteristic of
                which is to build on the memory of specific material through data collection. Archives are power
                devices that create realities by storing and making pieces of evidence accessible. Archival activism is
                directly related to community-based archives around the world It offers access to stories, evidence,
                facts and arguments that can be used to advance causes and social campaigns. They can be considered as
                a counterculture practices itself, archiving material that has not been recognized by the dominant
                official structures. The cases studies tagged in fulfill one or both functions. They embrace
                interactive features that allow users to explore the dataset through visualizations (on maps, networks,
                charts). In most cases users can download the databases, and contribute to data collection
                (crowdsourcing data).</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Monitoring:</strong> projects in this group seek to hold accountable and
                increase the transparency of the work done by top-down institutions by monitoring their actions: by
                constantly following, tracking, and comparing the changes. Often monitoring projects are fed by
                crowdsourced data. The audience isn’t only an observer but also a contributor of information. The
                action of monitoring comes alive not only in the results of the visualization but also through the
                process of audience participation (Briones, 2019). <strong>Maps of power</strong> is a sub-group that
                monitors the influence and power relations between actors and institutions. They highlight how power is
                connected in different contexts through network visualizations based fundamentally on network
                representations. However, there are several inventive explorations in the archive.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Reporting:</strong> this group is made up of projects that observe and share
                evidence about the general view of a phenomenon that has usually already occurred within a specific
                time range, and that can be verified by anyone. They seek above all to raise awareness and inform
                audiences. Although there is no completely "neutral" position, these reports tend to this position to
                provide facts and evidence of the phenomenon of.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Investigative:</strong> projects in this group are usually intended to be a
                catalyst for further questions rather than a snapshot of the current state of affairs. Investigative
                projects delve deeper into a specific topic, gathering information from different angles and exploring
                different documentation techniques. It includes projects that come close to the porous boundary of data
                journalism. Investigative projects shows great predominance of territorial evidence as a relevant
                strategy for situating the context of the investigation. They usually combine diverse data and
                information sources. They also visually experiment with multiple types of media for representing
                different angles of the topic being investigated. It is not common to find here crowdsourced data.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Social cohesion:</strong> the projects of this group seek to mobilize
                long-term movements, not just for specific events or campaigns. The projects of this cluster actively
                combine tactics in the public and virtual space (such as digital campaigns, physical activities and
                meetings such as protests, meetings, workshops, among others). They are projects that are close to the
                research group but that emphasize the integration of physical-digital action around the inquiry issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="sect3">About project’s topics and sub-topics</h2>
        <p class="text--big">Each project focuses on a particular topic. Topics were manually classified by defining a
            macro topic and related sub-thopics. The five major topicsare: Policymaking, Transparency and
            accountability, Human rights, Memory and archives, and Surveillance. The following diagram maps according
            to your topics, subtopics as well as representing the number and type of organization involved in each
            project. observed how the subtopics overlap and cross one topic with another. This classification seeks to
            give more entry points to the reading of the projects and how they represent conflicts.</p>

        <h2 id="sect4">About data acquisition category</h2>
        <p class="text--big">The archive emphasizes observing how visualization projects for alternative narratives
            work with the data. There are several questions that can be asked, from do they contain a methodology
            section that explains how you worked with the data? Do we know who created that data and how? This
            classification deals with understanding and showing how the data was acquired in each project. Based on the
            Mirén Gutiérrez classification published in his research Data Activism and Social Change (2018), the
            following categorization is proposed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Appropriate data:</strong> it's about grabbing existing data from other
                platforms from which there is no access. The appropriation of data literally means the access to data
                that is not accessible. This is the fundamental difference with open data or data exchange. Scraping is
                one of the most used technique.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Own research:</strong> project teams “conduct primary research whose findings
                can be datafied; or deploy data-collecting sensors, drones and other devices”. Some examples of
                creating data for research is through surveys, sensors, aerial imagery (community drones).</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Existing sources:</strong> produce new analysis from available, but unrelated
                and unexplored, datasets.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Collaboration with other organizations:</strong> collectives, foundations,
                organizations among others.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Crowdsourced:</strong> generate the means to crowdsource citizen-contributed
                data.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Whistle-blowers:</strong> this is the case when organizations or individuals
                are recipients of data via whistleçblowers such as leaks.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Governmental data but not public:</strong> this form of data acquisition is
                different from the others in that it is delivered directly by an entity such as the government to a
                particular organization to develop a project. It could be assumed that government data should be open
                to all, however this category emphasizes that they are delivered only for restricted purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text--big">The treemap diagram below visualizes relationships in the forms of data acquisition, the
            topics addressed and the types of projects. A project can acquire its data in more than one way, combining
            strategies in most cases.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/topicsChart.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Cluster of data acquisitions">
        <p class="text--big">Many of the projects state principles such as transparency and accountability, disclosure
            of power relations, or the right to open information. It is striking, however, that the vast majority of
            cases do not put much of these principles into practice through their own data visualizations by means that
            they don’t release the databases used in the visualizations, among other practices. From this can be
            inferred:</p>
        <ul class="plain--list">
            <li class="text--big">The weak relationship of open data culture linked to data visualizations.</li>
            <li class="text--big">The incoherence in the discourse of institutions that use data visualization to
                subvert the opacity of information by institutions of power.</li>
            <li class="text--big">The deliberate will not to share data due to other reasons not explicit in the
                projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text--big">All three are fairly generic conclusions but they provide first lines of action to foster
            a critical data culture. This research aims to contribute from design to a more critical and knowledgeable
            data culture, so it points its efforts to the first of these stated observations. How design can you
            contribute to a more critical data culture?</p>
        <h2 id="sect5">Some good practices for alternative narratives with data</h2>
        <p class="text--big">Through the collection of cases, some good practices were identified that serve to promote
            a more critical approach to the reading and construction of visualizations for alternative narratives. Some
            of them are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Declaration of licenses of use</strong> as creative commons, copyleft or Open
                Data Commons Open Database License.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Inclusion of a methodology section</strong> on data and its process of
                shaping research. In this section it is recommended to include how the data was acquired, who created
                the data and how, what were the research questions that guided the transformations in the data, among
                other things. Another practice recommended for this section is the disclosure of design decisions that
                were made to visualize the data. This should include from the description of the tools and visual
                models used.</li>
            <li class="text--big"><strong>Make the data used available</strong> if possible. One of the most common
                practices found is the inclusion of links to data sources. In a few cases there are direct download
                links to the already manipulated data that are used in the data visualizations. This is recommended
                since it allows the public to critically understand how the visualizations have been constructed. In
                case the data cannot be published, it is advisable to explain why not.</li>
