Citizens organized around the movement, claiming for justice and solution to their issues. One of this citizens organization called “15 M pa Rato” start inquiring about Bankia, one of the most controversial banks in Spain whose many middle and low class families were indebted. In 2014, an anonymous leak provide the emails exchange between the bank director and politicians and bankers during 2007. It comes to public light that 86 board members of having unduly expended 15,5 million EUR while people were losing their houses, jobs, education, etc. With these evidence, Spanish Justice started the process and put in jail almost all of them.\nMontera34 uses the leaks database to tell how, when and who used the Black cards.",

    "description": "The AEMP is “a radical data-visualization, data analysis, and multimedia storytelling collective documenting the dispossession and resistance of San Francisco Bay Area residents facing gentrifying landscapes” (Anti Eviction Mapping Project, 2018, p. 289). As a collective, they strive to make the often obscured mechanisms of material, cultural, and affective displacement palpable (Maharawal and McElroy, 2017). The AEMP is an example of how information visualizations (through data visualization on maps and data stories) organise and mobilize collective action and crowdsourced practices, empowering citizens through new evidence. The visualisations and data allow users to create a space where they can dissent, reveal and contest, situating the collective as a relevant actor in the conflict of displacement and gentrification.\nThe data reveals extensive displacement due to the Ellis Act, with most evictions occurring as a result of recent purchases, and uncovers a disturbing number of serial evictors. The collective started mapping evictions in the SF Bay Area in 2013 and has continued to do so until today, expanding the project to other areas (Alameda County, California, for instance). The mapping is done by crowdsourcing data collected through an online survey that volunteers compile. In addition, they use official governmental information about landlords and speculators. The more than 100 interactive maps are mainly created using Leaflet and D3 libraries, CartoDB and OpenStreetMap. Apart from building maps, they use the Crowdmap.com platform for comments. Through digital maps, oral history work, films, murals, and community events, the project uncovers the connections between the nodes and reveals the effects of new entanglements between global capital, real estate, high tech, and the political economy. It examines the displacement of people, but also of their complex social worlds, as certain spaces become desirable to such entanglements.",

This phenomenon is widespread at national level and covers both the territorial and socio-political levels.\nIn the absence of an official inventory, 'Cadáveres Inmobiliarios: Base de datos post-bubuja' is born as a collective project that pursues the location and documentation of all these developments that died before time.  \nThe aim of the project is to provide exhaustive information in an accessible way so that everyone can use it according to their interests. Although the mere fact of informing about this phenomenon is an implicit criticism of the development model based on brick, 'Cadáveres Inmobiliarios' aims to be the starting point for future projects that propose solutions to today's stagnant situations, thus fostering social awareness of a reality that defines us and to which we cannot turn our backs.",

Numerous other branches of the Mexican security apparatus either participated in or witnessed the events, including state and federal police and the military. Six people were murdered – including three students – forty wounded, and 43 students were forcibly disappeared.\nThe whereabouts of the students remains unknown, and their status as 'disappeared' persists to this day. Instead of attempting to solve this historic crime, the Mexican state has failed the victims, and the rest of Mexican society, by constructing a fraudulent and inconsistent narrative of the events of that night.\nThe  \"El caso Ayotzinapa\" project seeks to reconstruct the facts and the different narratives that exist around the attacks that occurred in September 2014 in Ayotzinapa. It is an interactive tool that maps and examines the facts, gathered by multiple means, that allows further investigation of the case. The platform provides all the data used for the virtual reconstruction of the events, as well as audiovisual material that helps to understand the order of events. It demonstrates, in a clear graphic and cartographic form, the level of collusion and coordination between state agencies and organised crime, throughout the night. It is relevant to mention that the platform was created in 2017 and has already been used to conduct successive investigations of the case, which is not yet closed.",

    "description": "Between 2003 and 2017, New York City had a very controversial program called Stop and Frisk that allowed police officers to stop people on the street they felt were a potential threat in an attempt to find and reclaim illegal weapons. The program became the subject of a racial profiling controversy. The vast majority, 90% in 2017, of those stopped were African-American or Latino, most of whom were aged 14–24. Furthermore, 70% of all those stopped were later found to be innocent. The racial disparity persists even after controlling for precinct variability and race-specific estimates of crime participation. Research suggests that stop-and-frisk had few effects, if any, on violent and property crime rates in New York City. After a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) resulted in the New York Police Department (NYPD) releasing all of their Stop and Frisk data publicly, people flocked to the data to independently pick apart how effective the program was.\nThe platform (not anymore available online) showed on a map the little correlation between the frequency of stop and frisk and the number of guns found as a result of stop and frisk. The visualization inquired on why were stop and frisk more likely in certain areas? \nThis project is one of the many ones that got interested in the database. Despite the relevance of the topic and the good motivations it followed, there are graphical issues in it. This article discuss the graphic decisions of the project https://spatialityblog.com/2012/07/27/nyc-stop-frisk-cartographic-observations.",

They are considered the most important mobilization in recent years in Chile, and one of the largest since the return to democracy after Pinochet’s dictatorship. Students called for reform in the education system, which favours private education that comes at a high costs and offers low quality results. The movement was strong enough to bring to the fore a discussion about changing the education system. The project invites people to add information and evidence through links to news articles about the different types of protests during the period. This map translates analogue processes into a database of happenings, public performances, demonstrations and occupations of public buildings. The map is a strategy in and of itself to narrate the popular protests of this period. By contributing to the datasource, people become deeply involved in the reconstruction of a significant event that left no physical trace. Nevertheless, neither of these two projects shared their databases, instead opting to make data available only through their explorative interfaces.",
